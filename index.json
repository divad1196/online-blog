The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python 🗲 Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, Jquery, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n7. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/skills/","summary":"Skills Languages French: Mother tongue English: B2 Cambridge certified (download) (~C1 estimated, not certified) German: B1 certified (download) (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo. You can find it on the odoo app store ","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/odoo/","summary":"Odoo I work on Odoo since 2018.
