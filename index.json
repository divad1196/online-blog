[{"content":"A Curious and Eager Learner I am a curious and eager learner with a strong interest in exploring and mastering a wide range of topics, particularly those related to science, logic, and technology.\nIn fact, I’m interested in most subjects — it’s really just a matter of time and resources.\nFor example, I’m interested in woodworking, electronics, and similar hobbies, but they can be expensive and take a lot of time to learn properly.\nI love brain teasers like puzzles or Sudoku. From time to time, I buy myself a new puzzle. I have now collected a nice little collection. I also enjoy learning languages. Recently, I started studying Japanese because I wanted to explore a language that is very different from what I already know, with its unique alphabet and structure.\na few examples I have my \u0026ldquo;phases\u0026rdquo;: I dive deeply into a topic for months or even years up to a point that I find satisfying.\nI care about doing things \u0026ldquo;the right way\u0026rdquo;, but I am also very pragmatic.\nOver the years, I had different hobbies:\nPlaying guitar Drawing and digital drawing Cooking, including techniques like making sushi and maintaining sharp knives Coffee \u0026amp; Tea extraction and degustation 3D modeling Learning about economy, marketing, and management Home gardening Workplace ergonomics, especially ergonomic mice, keyboards and chairs \u0026hellip; These hobbies are still part of my life, and I continue to practice and improve them, even if I now dedicate less time to each.\nInterest in others I also like to talk and share with others, but I don\u0026rsquo;t mean small talk. I prefer more thoughtful discussions and debates.\nI consider myself a good listener, always trying to see all sides of a situation.\nSociology fascinates me, I even dedicated my gymnasium maturity project to this topic.\nI’ve always been attentive to what people want, don’t want, say, or leave unsaid.\nWhile I might not make a huge display of sympathy, I am someone with a great empathy.\nHow I Landed in Computer Science Computer Science clicked for me relatively late. I was 21, studying Physics at the EPFL, when I discovered Linux and C++. It was a revelation.\nI began spending most of my free time learning programming and finally decided to change my career.\nThis was the best decision I ever made.\nI taught myself through online courses and personal projects and then landed a programming internship where I quickly made a strong impression. I gained responsibilities and got offered the opportunity to continue working at the company while completing my studies part-time over four years instead of three.\nComputer Science in general, not just programming, has become for me a passion.\nChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life\n— Confucius\n","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/who-am-i/","summary":"The person behind the engineer","title":"Who am I?"},{"content":"There are many candidates out there, each with technical skills and experience. So why choose me over them?\nMulti-Field Expertise I have solid experience across development, system administration, and cybersecurity, which allows me to see the bigger picture and make informed decisions.\nMy knowledge in each domain is strong on its own — especially in development — but combined, these skills reinforce each other and give me a unique perspective.\nLeadership and Project Management I combine deep technical knowledge with the ability to lead and deliver complex projects in a simple way.\nProject management is often criticized because either engineers who haven’t learned how to manage projects take the role, or managers without technical experience struggle to connect with the team.\nMy strong sense of empathy helps me bridge that gap, connecting management, engineers, and users or customers effectively.\nDeliver Results I focus on the big picture and consistently deliver results that exceed expectations.\nThis applies not only to my own tasks, but also to the projects I lead — even outside IT contexts.\nSummary Despite my relatively young age, I’m a Swiss-army knife capable of tackling complex problems and bringing large projects to life. I can develop advanced algorithms, troubleshoot intricate infrastructure issues, identify security risks, and lead teams to success.\n","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/why-choose-me/","summary":"The reasons why I am a good candidate","title":"Why choose me?"},{"content":"Here is a summary of my noticeable experiences.\nKudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / Saas solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandonned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Consolidation of inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardward and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

This pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\nI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\nMore information about the programming languages I use System Administrator (Linux) Beyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues. By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"Discover my main skills","title":"Skills"},{"content":"This file contains a list of technologies and tools I have actively used over the years.\nThese are just keywords but they give you an idea.\nNOTE: for some of these tools, my current knowledge might be a bit rusty or out-dated.\nProgramming Languages Python Rust Go Javascript C/C++ Java Bash SQL Clouds AWS Azure DigitalOcean Public-Cloud (Infomaniak) Git \u0026amp; CI/CD Github Gitlab (self-hosted) Azure DevOps AI/ML CrewAI Ollama PyTorch Tensorflow HuggingFace Containers/virtualization Docker Podman Kubernetes Helm OpenStack Jelastic Proxmox LXC/LXD System Administration Linux Terraform (+ Terragrunt) Ansible Fabrik Pulumi Vagrant Project Management Jira IceScrum Azure DevOps Security Metasploit Ghidra Volatility gdb pwntools wireshark scapy Snort OWASP ModSecurity Cryptography Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Digital Signature \u0026amp; Certificates (e.g x509, threshold-signatures, blockchain) Encryption (e.g. SSL/TLS, AES) Network iptables nftables PaloAlto Cisco OpenVPN nmap MassDNS Bind9 Monitoring Zabbix Grafana Prometheus and exporters (blackbox, snmp, \u0026hellip;) Alertmanager Fluentd Reverse Proxy Nginx Traefik Caddy Cloudflare Benchmark and Load Testing Apache Jmeter K6 Databases SQL Postgres Sqlite DuckDB REPMGR NoSQL Firebase MongoDB Redis ","permalink":"https://divad1196.github.io/online-blog/cv/skills/technologies/","summary":"A non-exhaustive list of the technologies that I have used","title":"Technologies \u0026 Tools"},{"content":"Timeline timeline 2016 : C++ : Bash 2018 : Python : Javascript : SQL 2019 : Java 2020 : Go 2022 : Rust Mastery Some more details below\n1.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack I took over the monitoring stack. It used Ansible and was in a broken state. The deployment pipelines were overly complex for no benefits, and many resources were unmanaged. Several expired certificates had broken the monitoring system.\nI fixed the deployments, simplified it and created a few custom Ansible plugins to streamline the dynamic retrieval of data from external sources in the playbooks. I also wrote a custom inventory plugin so that the inventory is dynamically maintained.\nOnce the stack was stable, I explored simpler and more maintainable deployment solutions to reduce operational complexity and improve reliability.\nNetBox Inventory NetBox is our main source of truth for network inventory. Its deployment was done on an old EC2 instance and the maintenance was done partially with Ansible but also a lot manually. I completely rewrote the deployment to run on ECS using Fargate, making it fully automated and easy to maintain/update. I developed multiple scripts to ingest data from existing network equipment, clean up inconsistancies.\nThe NetBox instance now serves as the authoritative inventory for other services, including monitoring, auditing and reporting.\nCloudflare We managed multiple domains on behalf of the corporate business.\nOur team acts as a service broker for other teams, and I also provide support and consulting to these teams.\nDenodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also activated features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.
